# Nonsense verse (and other creative uses of spelling) with Python and machine learning

PyCon 2020 Workshop / [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)

## Description

When Lewis Carroll wrote “Jabberwocky,” how did he know how to spell
“Jabberwock”? Why are some words (like “cellar door”) considered to be
pleasant, while others (“pulchritude,” “regurgitate”) ugly and harsh? In this
tutorial, we’ll learn how to use Pincelate, a Python library and machine
learning model, to analyze the sounds of words, and generate new words with
particular phonetic characteristics.

## Installation and notes

The Python libraries you'll need to install to follow along with this tutorial
are listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) in this repository. Here's
how I recommend setting up your system to follow along:

* Clone this repository
* Create a Python virtual environment, activate it, and install the
  requirements with `pip` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* Launch Jupyter Notebook at the command line with `jupyter notebook`.

This tutorial takes the form of a series of Jupyter Notebooks. If you're not
familiar with Jupyter Notebook, [consult the official
documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html) for a
quickstart guide, and then [my short tutorial
notebook](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/jupyter-notebook-tutorial.ipynb)
for basic commands and workflow tips.
