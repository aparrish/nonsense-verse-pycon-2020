    "The computational haiku has [vexed poets and programmers since at least 1967](http://rwet.decontextualize.com/pdfs/morris.pdf) and it is possible that there is little left to be said about the form. By \"haiku\" here I mean haiku as it has been adapted over the past century or more in English literature (see [Haiku in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English)), which is a form that strips out most of the semantic constraints of the original Japanese form in favor of a purely lexical and metrical definition: such a haiku consists of three lines, the first having five syllables, the second seven syllables, and the third five syllables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to write some code that goes through our corpus and finds haiku, in the manner of [Times Haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_in_English). Specifically, we'll identify sentences in our corpus that have seventeen syllables and can be partitioned into 5/7/5 lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting syllables is easy; what turns out to be a bit tricky is making sure that the words can be divided up into lines. The way we'll calculate this is to first make a list of syllable counts for each word in a sentence, then check to see if that sequence can be partitioned into a haiku. This function does the partitioning part, returning a list of indices where each line should end in the original list, or an empty list if no partition can be found:"
